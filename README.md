# Pantry

Pantry is a single page application built with [React](http://reactjs.org/). 

Pantry uses the [spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com) to offer suggestions for wine pairings.

Work in progress...

### V1

* Built search function
* Built introduction
* Fetch from API
* Show results for wine pairing and recipe

### Need to do

* Add an ability to search all over again after showing results
* Add ability to move through site using keyboard

### Possible improvements

* Allow latin letters
* On rare occasion, the API will fetch recipes that are mixed up within the array - in which case, I will have to map the array to every single kind of recipe case

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

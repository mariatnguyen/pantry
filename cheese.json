{"pairedWines":[],"pairingText":"The best wine for cheese definitely depends on the cheese. Aged cheeses and other intense cheeses go best with bold red wines, such as cabernet sauvignon or Nero d'Avola. Blue cheeses go well with sweet port wines. Soft cheeses like brie and camembert usually taste great with sparkling white wine. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific cheese type.","productMatches":[]}
